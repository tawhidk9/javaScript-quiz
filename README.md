# javaScript-quiz WIP

## Description

We were tasked to create a JS quiz application. Users should be able to start the game, answer each question and receive a feedback of "correct" or "incorrect", with the prior adding points to a scoreboard and the latter deducting time from a countdown timer. At the end of the game User can input their initials and save their score.

## Usage
Click on Start to start the quiz. Click on whatever answer choice to proceed to the next question. This is WIP so currently no scores are added and no feeback is shown. 

## Installation
No installation required.
